# My Favourite Software Tools for Building Stuff

Below is a curated list of software tools that help me build my projects. I occasionally recommend these
to my friends and decided to make a list of them.

## Stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): It's the first framework I learned to use and I've never had to switch.
I like the simplicity of the file based routing system and there's plenty of great documentation.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that helps me style websites quickly.
It eliminates the need to maintain separate CSS files and the headache of naming classes consistently.
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/): It's a wrapper around Postgres that provides all the backend services I need.

## Editor
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A simple code editor that has many extensions and nice themes. 
Although it freezes sometimes, I still use it over other editors.
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss): IntelliSense 
for Tailwind CSS. It gives me auto-completion and hover previews of the CSS used in the tailwind classes.
- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot): This is a must have for me.
The code completion and generation features speed up development significantly. Funny anecdote: [my video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nPoiUJpDaU)
on Copilot is among the most viewed on that topic.
- [VS Code Speech](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/voice): It enables you to talk with the editor and GitHub Copilot. Only recently started using this
but I like the idea of being able to code without typing. 
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): I format my code using prettier.
The extension itself isn't great but there are three plugins that really help: 
  - [`prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss): Sorts classes based on recommended order.
  - [`prettier-plugin-classnames`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-classnames): Wraps verbose class names - especially useful with Tailwind CSS.
  - [`prettier-plugin-merge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-merge/v/0.5.1): Plugin that sequentially applies the formatting rules of multiple plugins. 


## Design
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/): It's an icon library that you can import into your react applications. It
saves lot of time because I don't have to scour the web for icons. They have a consistent and minimal style which is also nice.
- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/): Another library of icons that I use if Lucide doesn't have what I need. The '.png' files are free and are available in different sizes.
- [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/): Sometimes use this to create and share formatted images of code snippets. Has several nice formatting options and applies syntax highlighting.
- [Mockups Design](https://mockups-design.com/): A collection of free and high quality mockups. I haven't used this one yet but it looks amazing nonetheless.
- [Landing Page Design Examples](https://landing-page-design-examples.vercel.app/): This is a repository of nice landing pages that I made a while ago. 
I didn't think that I would use it as much as I do today.
- [Shots](https://www.shots.so/): A free tool to make high quality mockup images on beautiful backgrounds.
- [Fluid Type Scale Calculator](https://www.fluid-type-scale.com/): Tool that generates font size variables for a fluid type scale.


## Miscellaneous
- [StippleGen](https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2012/stipplegen2/): A tool that converts images into stippled (dot) images. The images look nice and work well as backgrounds for dark mode.
- [SFXR](https://sfxr.me/): A free tool that generates 8-bit sound effects. Great first place to generate sound effects because there aren't any royalty of licensing issues when using this. 
- [Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/): Although I haven't used Lottie yet, it's caught my eye several times. It's a library of lightweight and editable animations.
